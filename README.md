# webpack-template

Template repository for Webpack 5 setup, with Prettier to make my code look nice, and Babel for pre-ES6 support.

To ensure full support of all browsers, though would bloat bundle, you can remove everything from the `.browserlistrc` file. By default, only browsers with >0.25% market share will be supported.
